#### App bundling <i class="material-icons mdl-color-text--grey-500">folder</i>

Bundling is the process of collecting all resources used in a page and then compiling
them into a single and optimized file. There are actually two way of doing this:

- **In-Browser** bundler:
this method does not requires any build tool nor plugins, it just works in the browser as-is.

- **Web-Starter** bundler:
is the [zuix-web-starter](https://github.com/genemars/zuix-web-starter) bare template,
with a bunch of extra features and enhancements. It requires *Node.js* to be installed.

This documentation will only cover the in-browser bundling method.

##### In-Browser bundling

So, when your website or application is ready for production it can be then bundled,
All of its components and resources will be crunched into a single file
and loaded from memory rather than from network/localhost.

Include the **zuix-bundler** extension script in your app right after the main *zuix*
script inclusion:

```html
<script src="js/zuix.js"></script>
<script src="https://genielabs.github.io/zuix/js/zuix-bundler.min.js"></script>
```

After adding this script you can generate the application bundle by typing in
the **developer console** of the browser the command

```javascript
zuix.saveBundle()
```

This will generate and save the **app.bundle.js** file to the *Downloads* folder.

Copy the generated file in your website/app root and include it right after
the main *zuix* script inclusion.

```html
<script src="js/zuix.js"></script>
<script src="app.bundle.js"></script>
```

All components and resources are now loaded in memory with just one file.
This will speed-up application loading and promptness and it will consequently
improve user experience.

Remove the `zuix-bundler` script inclusion from your app after the bundle is created.


###### Remarks

When using lazy-loading only components loaded so far will be included in the bundle (incremental bundling).

To force inclusion of all components/resources used in the app, issue the following commands in the console:

```javascript
// disable lazy-loading
zuix.lazyLoad(false)
// force loading of all components
zuix.componentize()
// create the bundle
zuix.saveBundle()
```

Also external JavaScript libraries and CSS files can be included in the app bundle.
In order to achieve this, remove the `<script src="..."></script>` or `<link rel="stylesheet">`
and use the method `zuix.using(...)` instead to load the script/css.

<small><strong>EXAMPLE</strong></small>
```javascript
const flaCss = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flex-layout-attribute/1.0.3/css/flex-layout-attribute.min.css';
zuix.using('style', flaCss, function(res, styleObject) {
    console.log("Added Flex Layout Attributes CSS.", res, styleObject);
});
const momentJs = 'https://momentjs.com/downloads/moment.js';
zuix.using('script', momentJs, function(res, scriptObject){
    console.log("Added Moment.js.", res, scriptObject);
});
zuix.using('component', 'kit/extensions/animate_css', function(res, componentContext){
   console.log("Added AnimateCSS extension for zUIx.", res, componentContext);
});
```

If the `zuix.using` method is called on a resource that was already loaded, it will
just ignore the request.

This is useful since it can be used to create **self-contained components** that
can be loaded without having to worry about the dependencies.
