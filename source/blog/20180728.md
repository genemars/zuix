## What is a ViewPager?

As described in *Android Developers* documentation, a *ViewPager* is a

> Layout manager that allows the user to flip left and right through pages of data.

## Example application

The example app design was initially inspired to *Twitter* mobile but it can be used and adapted as a starting base for different kind of projects.

![Web App 4-1](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/f3mib65guw55oj39n83k.gif)

Design summary:

- responsive
- main `view_pager` to switch between content sections
- side drawer with options menu that can be open by tapping the user avatar
- collapsing header/footer when scrolling up, expanding when scrolling down
- page indicator with section names (it's just another `view_pager`)

Fully playable source on *Glitch*:

I recommend trying this example also  full screen with the <small>**direct link**</small> [zuix-app-4.glitch.me](https://zuix-app-4.glitch.me).


## Structure

The app consists of a main `index` and the following elements:

```
// a small component implementing a 'card'
// with a picture and random data

components/random_item.css
components/random_item.html
components/random_item.js

// a static list used in each ViewPager page
// and that holds a bunch of 'random_item'

content/fake_list.css
content/fake_list.html

// the menu used in the side `drawer_layout'

content/user_menu.css
content/user_menu.html

// the header bar with a title, clickable
// user profile avatar and sections names

layout/header.css
layout/header.html

// a footer bar with links to main app screens

layout/footer.css
layout/footer.html

// the main app files

index.css
index.html
index.js
```

So, the `index.html` page includes:

- `layout/header`
- `layout/footer`
- the `drawer_layout` which content is loaded from `content/user_menu`
- a `view_pager` to implement the page indicator (tab layout) with the section names (*Feed*,*Week*,*Month*,etc..)
- main `view_pager` which holds the pages of each section that contain the `fake_list` populated with `random_item`s

I hope this make sense =) and that the code is easy to understand even for a beginner. If not, feel free to leave a comment, I'll do my best to improve this.
