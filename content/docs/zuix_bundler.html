#### App Bundler <i class="material-icons mdl-color-text--grey-500">folder</i>

When your site or application is ready for production it can then be bundled so that all of its components and resources
will be crunched into a single file.

This can be done directly from the browser with the `zuix-bundler` extension script.

This extension adds the `saveBundle` method to the `zuix` object that is meant to be called from the browser's
developer console.

#### Usage

Include the **zuix-bundler** extension script in your app right after the main *zuix* script inclusion:

```html
<script src="https://genielabs.github.io/zuix/js/zuix-bundler.min.js"></script>
```

After adding this script you can create an application bundle by typing in the browser's developer console

```javascript
zuix.saveBundle()
```

After the bundle is created it will be downloaded by the browser as **app.bundle.js** file that you can then compress/minify,
copy and include into your app right after the main *zuix* script inclusion.

###### Example

```html
<script src="js/app.bundle.js"></script>
```

This way all components and resources will be loaded into memory with just one file and this will speed-up application
loading and promptness and will consequently improve user experience.

###### Remarks

When using lazy-loading only components loaded so far will be included in the bundle (incremental bundling).

To force inclusion of all components/resources used in the app, issue the following commands in the console:

```javascript
// disable lazy-loading
zuix.lazyLoad(false)
// force loading of all components
zuix.componentize()
// create the bundle
zuix.saveBundle()
```

Remove the `zuix-bundler` script inclusion from your app after the bundle is created.
