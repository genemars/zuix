#### App Bundler <i class="material-icons mdl-color-text--grey-500">folder</i>

When your website or application is ready for production it can then be bundled,
so that all of its components and resources will be crunched into a single file
and loaded from memory rather than from network/localhost.

This can be done directly in the browser using the `zuix-bundler` script.
This script extends the `zuix` object with the `saveBundle` method.


##### Usage

Include the **zuix-bundler** extension script in your app right after the main *zuix*
script inclusion:

```html
<script src="js/zuix.js"></script>
<script src="https://genielabs.github.io/zuix/js/zuix-bundler.min.js"></script>
```

After adding this script you can generate the application bundle by typing in
the **developer console** of the browser the command

```javascript
zuix.saveBundle()
```

This will generate and save the **app.bundle.js** file to the *Downloads* folder.

Copy the generated file in your website/app root and include it right after
the main *zuix* script inclusion.

```html
<script src="js/zuix.js"></script>
<script src="app.bundle.js"></script>
```

All components and resources are now loaded in memory with just one file.
This will speed-up application loading and promptness and it will consequently
improve user experience.

Remove the `zuix-bundler` script inclusion from your app after the bundle is created.


###### Remarks

When using lazy-loading only components loaded so far will be included in the bundle (incremental bundling).

To force inclusion of all components/resources used in the app, issue the following commands in the console:

```javascript
// disable lazy-loading
zuix.lazyLoad(false)
// force loading of all components
zuix.componentize()
// create the bundle
zuix.saveBundle()
```

Also any other JavaScript library and CSS file can be included in the app bundle.
In order to achieve this, remove the `<script src="..."></script>` or `<link rel="stylesheet">`
and use the method `zuix.using(...)` instead to load the script/css.

<small><strong>EXAMPLE</strong></small>
```javascript
var flaCss = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flex-layout-attribute/1.0.3/css/flex-layout-attribute.min.css';
zuix.using('style', flaCss, function(res, styleObject) {
    console.log("Add Flex Layout Attributes CSS.", res, styleObject);
});
var momentJs = 'https://momentjs.com/downloads/moment.js';
zuix.using('script', momentJs, function(res, scriptObject){
    console.log("Added Moment.js.", res, scriptObject);
});
zuix.using('component', 'kit/extensions/animate_css', function(res, componentContext){
   console.log("Added AnimateCSS extension for zUIx.", res, componentContext);
});
```

If the `zuix.using` method is called on a resource that was already loaded, it will
just ignore the request.
This is useful since it can be used to create self-contained components that
can be loaded without having to worry about the dependencies.
